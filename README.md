To run the PercolationVisualiser.java
Make sure the Course API's are installed on your system and in the Terminal use these commands:
```
javac-algs4 PercolationVisualizer.java
java-algs4 PercolationVisualizer percolation_input.txt
```
You compile and then run the visualizer.  

#### Week 2 - Stacks, Queues and Resizing Arrays
Week 2 introduces Stacks and Queues and their implementations.  Looks at two main ways to deal with mutable arrays.

1. Resizing arrays. Doubling the size of the array when it is full. And when the array is 1/4 full, half it.
2. Stacks or Queues. Stacks are LIFO and Queues are FIFO.
