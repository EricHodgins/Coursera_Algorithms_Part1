To run the PercolationVisualiser.java
Make sure the Course API's are installed on your system and in the Terminal use these commands:
```
javac-algs4 PercolationVisualizer.java
java-algs4 PercolationVisualizer percolation_input.txt
```
You compile and then run the visualizer.  

## Week 2 - Stacks, Queues and Resizing Arrays
Week 2 introduces Stacks and Queues and their implementations.  Looks at two main ways to deal with mutable arrays.

1. Resizing arrays. Doubling the size of the array when it is full. And when the array is 1/4 full, half it.
2. Stacks or Queues. Stacks are LIFO and Queues are FIFO.


## Week 3 - Sorting: Merge and Quick Sort.
Week 3 introduces two non-trivial sorting algorithms.  Merge and Quick sort.  Both are nlgn time complexity.  Quick is
probably quicker in practice.

## Week 4 - Priority Queues, Heap Sort, BST's
Week 4 introduces Priority Queues, BST's, Heap sort and later introducing BST's and Symbol tables.  The assignment entails implementing the A * algorithm to solve an 8puzzle problem.
